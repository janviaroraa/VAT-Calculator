VAT is a kind of tax levied on the sale of goods and services when these commodities are ultimately sold to the consumer. VAT is an integral part of the GDP of any country. While VAT is levied on the sale of goods and services and paid by producers to the government, the actual tax is levied from customers or end-users who purchase these goods and services.

VAT calculator is a tool you can use to compute the amount of VAT you need to pay and the gross price of the product based on its net value. You can even reset all the values and calculate the VAT as many times as you want without refreshing the page.
